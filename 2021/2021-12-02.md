- Minutes location

    - We'll move minutes over to GitHub
    - Primary reason for leaving in Google Foc was ease of use and colaborative editing
    - Using VS Code live share and GitHub.dev we can still collaboratively edit but straight into markdown :tada:

- Website GitHub Issues
    - Volunteer page doesn't actually say what SR is, which could confuse new volunteers
        - We should fix this
        - James to take a look
    - Do we need the "Teams Dashboard" page
        - Doesn't really add anything other than clear links to docs for teams?
        - Could we just add docs to nav bar?
            - Originally switched away as there were links to Docs, IDE and Forum but now IDE is gone and Forum is just a link to the docs, think we could just use the one link?
        - It does also show blog posts and upcoming events but the main homepage has these (though admittedly quite far down)
            - We could look at surfacing events and blog posts on the home page as a seperate issue
        - Lets remove the teams dashboard
    - We should make the Latest Blog Posts section of the website show the first paragraph inline

- Sponsor logos
    - Hills Road
        - We still don't have a logo for Hills Road Sixth Form College
        - We sent an email to David Massey asking for it a couple of weeks ago
        - Lets ask David again to see if he's managed to get around to it
    - IET
        - Scarzy sent over their "Media Toolkit"
        - We need to follow these guidelines when using their logo
        - Prior to publishing the changes to the site to include their logo the IET need to sign off
        - Scarzy is double checking but we believe this also includes not creating a PR on GitHub until they have signed off on a screenshot
        - Antoine has found thier marketing guidlines with specific logo rules

- Blog Posts
    - Antoine has sent over the Where Are They Now question set for Isabel to forward on to her ex competitors
    - Meet The Team
        - Have asked Andy Busse, Diane, and Peter if they are interested
        - All say that they are interested, but likely a delay before getting answers

- Destination Data
    - We have some destination data now for where ex-competitors have ended up
    - We should try and continue to add to this set of data to be able to answer questions like where do our competitors end up
    - Lets make a google form that we can ask team leaders to share with competitors
    - We could also share the form on social media and ask ex-competitors to fill it in?

- Sponsored Social Posts
    - We have contact details for Adventurous Machines
    - Now the competition year has begun we should reach out to discuss the content of their shout out tweet

- Social media posts
    - Upcoming posts
         - Tech day announcement
    - Online presence tracking
        - HRS done a couple of tweets
        - KEG also done did a tweet
        - Lots of activity in discord, we should decide how much this get factored into online presences
            - Lets decide this next week
        - We should make a spreadsheet to track this

- New volunteers
    - One new signup
        - Offered them an inital call, not scheduled one yet though
        - Have sent a welcome message in Slack
    - Should we make a glossary of SR jargon?
        - Welcome message in slack mentions that if they don't know what something means to just ask but we have lots of Acronymns, Initialisms, Teams, Code Names
        - Things off the top of our head
            - TLA
            - RUB
            - SRO
            - SUSU
            - Doing vs Meeting
            - Ship It
            - The container
