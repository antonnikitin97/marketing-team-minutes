            - We had planned on one a month but on second thought probably a good idea to do these with only a week or so in between
        - Team supervisor post
            - We should get this out ASAP. Ideally we should include this in confirmation email
            - Has comments needs some review + tweaks
        - Theme
            - Largely complete other than adding some previous teams with good designs
            - We should review this + add the old teams + then schedule
        - Post Kickstart
            - Hasn't been started yet, only some top level ideas
            - Hannah up for doing some of the basics
    - SR2022 Competitor Spotlight
