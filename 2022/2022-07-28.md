 - Regular social media during the competition year
  - We should aim to continue this outside the competition year
 - 3 of our 4 blog posts about ex-competitors were people from the Collyers team, could appear a little biased

 - We should use TikTok more, as that is where competitors are
 - SRAWN started well but was often late
  - Last SRAWN still not posted
