## Topics

- Kickstart
    - Livestream was good
        - We could have set this up earlier if we got into the venue earlier
        - Not 1080p but 720p wasn't too bad
        - We should have thought about Q&A and reapting questions/answers not on mic
            - Wandering Mic?
        - We should have prepped livestream producer on when to start/stop streaming
            - After housekeeping slides + end on clapping
        - Better social media coverage
            - Should have pictures of presentation/buildings
            - TikTok content etc.
        - Before next event (likely a tech day) we should plan social media strategy for during the event
    - Photos from Kickstart
        - Some photos were taken by a couple of volunteers
        - We should have a place for these to be stored
        - Difficulty is that we don't have media consent for this event so would have to cherry pick photos to be of backs of heads / non identifable
        - Going forward we will put photos in to Google Drive first and then we can upoad them to a public Google Photos album if they can be shared
- Onboarding
    - We have a few people to respond to which we said we'd do after Kickstart
    - E should get a buddy and encouraged to join competition team meeting
    - James and Anotine now have extra SR Tshirts, we can start thinking about shipping these to new volunteers.
        - We should get A5 flyers printed to include in this pack
        - Also maybe branded pens?
        - Maybe Stickers?
- Blog Posts
    - Post Kickstart News Article
        - Needs to be published as soon as possible.
        - James to write this evening.
    - Kit Revision Post
        - We didn't get this published when we wanted which is a shame
        - We'll publish this evening and push back the Kickstart news article a few days
    - Robot 101: Robot Design
        - Keith might be interested in helping with this
