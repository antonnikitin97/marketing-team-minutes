## Topics

We should have a social
- Blog Posts
  - 101 series is a good idea
    - We were missing topics on sensors/electronics
    - We should share the fact we're doing this series more widely in slack and ask for input from anyone that wants to help
- Onboarding
  - Onboarding of latest Kit Team volunteer didn't seem fantastic
    - A little thrown in the deep end, Josh managed to jump in and say hello but shouldn't rely on ad-hoc
      - Lots of Jargon, which had to be explained
        - We have a Glossary but not advertised very well
      - Buddy system seems like the way to go, we should reach out and try to get some volunteers from each team to be on hand.
      - If poss buddy on welcome call but not necessary of scheduling is hard.
      - At all committees meeting we should re state how onboarding works, advertise buddy system, offer support, ask for patience
  - SR accounts can be a barrier to entry given how much is in Google Drive
  - We should have a useful links for volunteers page on the website
    - Safeguarding Policy + instructions for acknowldgemtn
    - Calendar
    - Glossary
    - Runbook
    - Ops Manual
    - GitHub Org
    - Tasks
- Social
  - Virtual social towards the end of this month
  - We should try for some in person socials, tech days lend themselved to these
- SR(A)WN
  - Lets try having a submission thread in Slack for SR(A)WN
  - People are already in slack might be conducive to keeping submission threads up to date
  - Sam agreed to help send SR(A)WN
- Safeguarding
  - We should ideally have a way of knowing if we need to chase people
  - We should check that exsiting volunteers know about the safeguarding policies and that they need to acknowledge
