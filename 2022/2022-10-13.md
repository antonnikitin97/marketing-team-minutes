## Topics

- Kickstart
    - Livestream
        - We need to do a livestream as many many teams aren't attending in person
        - Audio for last in person Kickstart was not great so that's what we want to improve
        - Using a lav mic into a meet call seems to work ok
        - We should have a backup plan (maybe a phone or two also recording audio that we could splice in later)
        - Use James's DSLR for video
        - Use James's Laptop for livestreaming
        - Need people monitoring chat for questions and dump them somewhere central (plus filter and curate these)
        - Need someone to relay questions to Jake
        - Antoine has scheduled a livestream on Youtube for us to use
    - Social Media
        - New sponsor is going to try and put together some promotional short form videos using clips from the last competition
        - We should schedule our own posts
- Sponsors
    - We had a meeting with our new sponsor
    - They have offered to help with marketing
    - They want to coordinate the announcement of their support so we won't publish anything with their name just yet
- Kit Video
    - Antoine + Viv (and Tommy) filmed this. Many thanks
    - Going great!
    - Just needs audio + editing (hopefully about a day)
    - Kit team left comments on script so these are being reviewed
- Blog Posts
    - 101: Supervisor
        - This has been published
        - We should tweak the meta description
        - We should advertise this on social media
        - We should send this to team supervisors
